# 🩺 Multiple Disease Prediction System

This project is a **Multiple Disease Prediction System** built using machine learning. It enables users to predict the likelihood of having diseases such as **Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease** based on medical input features. The goal is to assist early diagnosis and raise awareness about potential health risks.

## 🔍 Features

- Predicts:
  - **Diabetes**
  - **Heart Disease**
  - **Parkinson’s Disease**
- Separate ML models for each disease with high accuracy
- User-friendly interface using Streamlit
- Clean and responsive design for better usability

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

| Disease         | Algorithm Used           |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Diabetes        | Support Vector Machine (SVM) |
| Heart Disease   | Logistic Regression / Random Forest |
| Parkinson’s     | Random Forest / XGBoost         |

## 🧪 Datasets

- **Diabetes Dataset**: [Kaggle - PIMA Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Heart Disease Dataset**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
- **Parkinson's Dataset**: [UCI Parkinson Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons)
